- Understanding Time & Space complexity (Big-O notation)
- Solve 3 LeetCode (Easy–Medium) problems daily
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles:
  - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Manual Testing concepts (Test cases, Bug life cycle, STLC, SDLC)

### 💡 Days 4–7: Advanced Programming & Patterns
- Core Data Structures:
  - Arrays, LinkedLists, HashMaps, Stacks, Queues
- Algorithmic techniques:
  - Searching and Sorting (Binary Search, QuickSort, MergeSort)
- Trees and Graphs (basic overview and optional deep-dive)
- Design Patterns relevant for testing:
  - Page Object Model (POM)
  - Factory Pattern
  - Builder Pattern

## ⚙️ Week 2: Test Automation Fundamentals

### 🧪 Days 8–10: Framework and TestNG Basics
- TestNG core concepts
- Assertions, annotations (`@Test`, `@Before`, `@After`, etc.)
- Testing architecture principles: reusability, scalability, maintainability
- Build a basic reusable test framework using Java + TestNG

### 🌐 Days 11–14: Web Automation with Selenium
- Selenium WebDriver core concepts and setup
- Locators: `id`, `name`, `css`, `xpath`
- Synchronization: Implicit, Explicit, Fluent Waits
- `Actions` class: drag and drop, hover, keyboard, etc.
- Implement Page Object Model
- Build a mini e-commerce site test project

## 🔌 Week 3: API Testing & Advanced Topics

### 🔄 Days 15–17: API Testing (Rest Assured/Postman)
- REST API principles (CRUD, statelessness)
- Tools:
  - Postman (Collections, Environment, Pre-request scripts)
  - Rest Assured basics and advanced validations
- JSON parsing (using GSON, Jackson)
- OAuth 1.0/2.0, API Keys, and Token Handling
- HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and status codes
- API Test Framework Design (data-driven, reusable utilities)
- Mocking with Postman Mock Server / WireMock

### ⚙️ Days 18–21: CI/CD and Test Infrastructure
- CI/CD Fundamentals: Jenkins, GitHub Actions basics
- Docker for testers: containers, Dockerfile, Selenium Grid setup
- Cross-browser testing strategies and cloud options (BrowserStack/SauceLabs)
- Test reporting: Allure Reports setup and integration
- Parallel and distributed testing

---

## 💼 Week 4: System Design & Interview Practice

### 🧩 Days 22–24: System & Framework Design
- Common test automation architecture patterns
- Choosing the right framework (Hybrid vs Modular vs Data-Driven)
- Configuration management using `config.properties`, `YAML`
- End-to-End framework design task:
  - Web + API + Data handling + Reporting + CI setup

### 🎤 Days 25–27: Mock Interviews & Scenario Practice
- Daily mock interviews (1 per day)
- Coding exercises in a whiteboard/online IDE format
- System design walkthrough (automation architecture)
- Common QA scenarios: regression, flaky tests, handling bugs

### 🎯 Days 28–30: Final Interview Prep & Soft Skills
- STAR Method practice (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Project explanation walkthrough (domain, tech stack, challenges)
- Behavioral questions:
  - Conflict resolution
  - Feedback handling
  - Career goals
- Framework optimization and review
- Final mock interview with feedback

---

## ✅ Tips for Success

- Keep a coding journal for mistakes and learnings.
- Practice explaining frameworks as if teaching someone.
- Record mock interviews for self-review.
- Focus on debugging and logs during tests.

Good luck! 🚀
