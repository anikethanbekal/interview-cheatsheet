# üß† Problem: Validate API response fields using string assertions

> **Category**: SDET Use Cases  
> **Tags**: string manipulation, java, python

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Define a function to solve the following:

Validate API response fields using string assertions.

---

## ‚òï Java Solution

```java
// 1. Assert that a response contains a field value
public static boolean assertFieldContains(String response, String field, String expectedValue) {
    return response.contains(field + ":" + expectedValue);
}

// 2. Assert that a response does not contain a field
public static boolean assertFieldAbsent(String response, String field) {
    return !response.contains(field + ":");
}
```

---

## üîµüü° Python Solution

```python
# 1. Assert that a response contains a field value
def assert_field_contains(response, field, expected_value):
    return f"{field}:{expected_value}" in response

# 2. Assert that a response does not contain a field
def assert_field_absent(response, field):
    return f"{field}:" not in response
```

---

## üîç Explanation

- Use string containment to check for field presence or absence in a response.
- Simple and works for flat string responses; for JSON, parse and check keys/values.

**Edge Cases:**
- Field present but value different: not matched.
- Field substring in another field: may cause false positives.
- For structured data, use a parser.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Language | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Java     | O(n)            | O(1)             | n = length of response |
| Python   | O(n)            | O(1)             | n = length of response |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Interview Tips / Notes

- Make sure to handle edge cases.
- Keep solutions readable and efficient.
- Be ready to discuss time and space trade-offs.
