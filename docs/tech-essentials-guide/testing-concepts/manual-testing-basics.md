## 🧠 Introduction to Manual Testing

Manual testing involves manually verifying software for defects by simulating end-user behavior. It requires analytical skills, domain expertise, and proficiency in test execution to ensure the software meets functionality and quality standards.

### 🔑 Importance of Manual Testing
- **Human Insight**: Identifies usability and design flaws that automation may miss.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to exploratory and ad-hoc testing scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Helps uncover edge cases and scenarios where automation is impractical.

## 🧰 Types of Manual Testing

### 🔥 Smoke / Sanity Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify basic functionality of the application.
- **Example**: Checking if the login page loads correctly.

### ✅ Functional Testing
- **Purpose**: Validate that the application behaves as expected.
- **Example**: Testing if a user can successfully place an order.

### 🔗 Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure modules work together seamlessly.
- **Example**: Testing the interaction between the payment gateway and the order system.

### 🌐 End-to-End Testing
- **Purpose**: Test the entire application workflow.
- **Example**: Simulating a user journey from registration to checkout.

### 🔄 Regression Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify that new changes haven’t broken existing functionality.
- **Example**: Retesting login functionality after a code update.

### 🔍 Exploratory Testing
- **Purpose**: Ad-hoc testing to discover issues without predefined cases.
- **Example**: Randomly navigating through the application to find bugs.

### 🚀 Performance Testing
- **Purpose**: Assess application speed and stability.
   - 💪 **Stress Testing**: Test system behavior under extreme load.
   - 📈 **Load Testing**: Test system behavior under expected load.

## 🔄 Manual Testing Process

### Step-by-Step Process
1. 📜 **Requirement Analysis**: Understand the requirements and scope of testing.
2. 📝 **Test Planning**: Define the testing strategy, timeline, and resources.
3. 🧪 **Test Case Design**: Create detailed test cases based on requirements.
4. 🛠️ **Test Environment Setup**: Prepare the testing environment and data.
5. 🚀 **Test Execution**: Execute test cases and document results.
6. 🐞 **Defect Reporting**: Log defects in a defect tracking tool.
7. ✅ **Test Closure**: Summarize testing activities and results.
