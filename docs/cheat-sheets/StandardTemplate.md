# 📘 Manual Testing Basics

Manual Testing is the process of manually checking software for defects.
It requires a tester to play the role of an end user and use most of the application's features
to ensure correct behavior.

---

## 🧠 What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing involves testing software manually without using automation tools.
Testers write test cases, execute them, and report bugs based on observations.

---

## ✅ Key Concepts

- **Test Case**: A set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality.
- **Test Plan**: A document that outlines the strategy, scope, and timeline for testing.
- **Bug Report**: A report logged in a defect management system describing a found issue.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing without predefined cases, focusing on discovery.
- **Smoke Testing**: Initial testing to check basic functionality.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifying previously working functionality after code changes.

## 🔄 Manual vs Automation Testing

| Feature               | Manual Testing                        | Automation Testing                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Execution             | Performed by humans                    | Performed by tools/scripts             |
| Speed                 | Slower                                 | Faster                                 |
| Cost                  | Higher over time                       | Lower for repetitive tasks             |
| Accuracy              | Prone to human error                   | High if scripts are reliable           |
| Best for              | Exploratory, usability, ad-hoc tests   | Repetitive, regression, performance    |

## 🧰 Common Tools in Manual Testing

- **Test Case Management**: TestLink, TestRail, Zephyr
- **Defect Tracking**: Jira, Bugzilla, MantisBT
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Google Docs

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Understand the requirements before testing
- Write clear, concise test cases
- Reproduce bugs consistently
- Maintain traceability between test cases and requirements
- Collaborate with developers and product owners

---

## 💡 Tips for SDETs and QA Engineers

- Learn to document test cases for both manual and automation workflows
- Manual testing builds intuition for edge cases that automation may miss
- It's often the first step before automating complex test cases
