# üìò Java Keywords

Java has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers.

## üß† The Keywords

| Keyword | Description |
|---|---|
| `abstract` | A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects. An abstract method has no body and belongs to an abstract class. |
| `assert` | For debugging. Used for declaring an expected boolean condition in a program. |
| `boolean` | A data type that can only store `true` and `false` values. |
| `break` | Breaks out of a `switch` statement or a loop. |
| `byte` | A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. |
| `case` | Marks a block of code in `switch` statements. |
| `catch` | Catches exceptions generated by `try` statements. |
| `char` | A data type that is used to store a single character. |
| `class` | Used to declare a class. |
| `const` | Not used, but a reserved keyword. |
| `continue` | Continues to the next iteration in a loop. |
| `default` | Specifies the default block of code in a `switch` statement. |
| `do` | Used together with `while` to create a do-while loop. |
| `double` | A data type that can store fractional numbers from 1.7e‚àí308 to 1.7e+308. |
| `else` | Used in conditional statements. |
| `enum` | A special class that represents a group of constants. |
| `extends` | Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class). |
| `final` | A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes, and methods, making them non-changeable. |
| `finally` | Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not. |
| `float` | A data type that can store fractional numbers from 3.4e‚àí038 to 3.4e+038. |
| `for` | Creates a for loop. |
| `goto` | Not used, but a reserved keyword. |
| `if` | Makes a conditional statement. |
| `implements` | Implements an interface. |
| `import` | Used to import a package, class, or interface. |
| `instanceof` | Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface. |
| `int` | A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. |
| `interface` | Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods. |
| `long` | A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. |
| `native` | Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file, but in another language. |
| `new` | Creates new objects. |
| `package` | Declares a package. |
| `private` | An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class. |
| `protected` | An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses. |
| `public` | An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class. |
| `return` | Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method. |
| `short` | A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767. |
| `static` | A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class. |
| `strictfp` | Restricts the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations. |
| `super` | Refers to superclass (parent) objects. |
| `switch` | Selects one of many code blocks to be executed. |
| `synchronized` | A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time. |
| `this` | Refers to the current object in a method or constructor. |
| `throw` | Creates a custom error. |
| `throws` | Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method. |
| `transient` | A non-access modifier, which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state. |
| `try` | Creates a try...catch statement. |
| `void` | Specifies that a method should not have a return value. |
| `volatile` | Indicates that an attribute may be changed by multiple threads. |
| `while` | Creates a while loop. |
