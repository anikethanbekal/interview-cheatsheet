# üìò Advanced Java Topics for SDETs

This cheat sheet covers advanced topics that are highly beneficial for experienced SDETs.

## üß† Multithreading

Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. This is particularly useful for running tests in parallel.

### Creating Threads

1.  **Extending the `Thread` class:**

    ```java
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running.");
        }
    }

    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    t1.start();
    ```

2.  **Implementing the `Runnable` interface (Recommended):**

    ```java
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running.");
        }
    }

    Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
    t1.start();
    ```

### `synchronized` Keyword

The `synchronized` keyword is used to create synchronized blocks or methods, ensuring that only one thread can execute that code at a time.

```java
public synchronized void myMethod() {
    // ... thread-safe code
}
```

## ‚úÖ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

JDBC is an API for connecting and executing queries on a database.

### Steps to Connect to a Database

1.  **Load the driver:** `Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");`
2.  **Create a connection:** `Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);`
3.  **Create a statement:** `Statement stmt = con.createStatement();`
4.  **Execute the query:** `ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");`
5.  **Process the result set:**
    ```java
    while (rs.next()) {
        System.out.println(rs.getInt(1) + "  " + rs.getString(2));
    }
    ```
6.  **Close the connection:** `con.close();`

## ‚úÖ Build & Dependency Management (Maven)

Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (Project Object Model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.

### `pom.xml` Example

This is the core of a Maven project.

```xml
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- Selenium Dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
            <version>4.10.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <!-- TestNG Dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
            <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
            <version>7.7.1</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

### Common Maven Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `mvn clean` | Deletes the `target` directory (compiled code and build artifacts). |
| `mvn compile` | Compiles the source code of the project. |
| `mvn test` | Run the tests for the project. |
| `mvn package` | Takes the compiled code and packages it in its distributable format, such as a JAR. |
| `mvn install` | Installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally. |

## üí° Tips for SDETs

- Use **multithreading** with test frameworks like TestNG to run your UI or API tests in parallel, significantly reducing execution time.
- Use **JDBC** to programmatically interact with your application's database to set up test data before a test run or to verify that data was correctly updated after a test.
- Master **Maven** or Gradle to manage your test automation project's dependencies and to integrate your tests into a CI/CD pipeline.
