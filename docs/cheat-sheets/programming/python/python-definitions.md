# üìò Key Python Definitions

This cheat sheet provides clear definitions and code examples for core Python terms.

---

## ‚úÖ GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)

**Definition:**
The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time. This means that even on a multi-core processor, only one thread can be executing Python code at any given moment. The GIL simplifies memory management but is a performance bottleneck for CPU-bound multi-threaded programs.

## ‚úÖ PEP 8

**Definition:**
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides conventions for writing readable and consistent Python code. Following PEP 8 is highly recommended.

**Example:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit lines to 79 characters.
- Use snake_case for function and variable names.

## ‚úÖ Virtual Environment

**Definition:**
A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. It allows you to work on a specific project without affecting other projects.

**Example:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate it
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## ‚úÖ `__pycache__`

**Definition:**
A directory that contains the `.pyc` files (compiled bytecode) for a Python module. When you run a Python program, the interpreter checks for a `__pycache__` directory and uses the `.pyc` files if they are up-to-date, which speeds up startup time.

---

## ‚úÖ `__name__ == "__main__"`

**Definition:**
A common idiom in Python scripts. The `__name__` variable is a special built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. This allows you to write code that will only be executed when the file is run as a script, but not when it is imported as a module into another script.

**Example:**

```python
def main():
    print("Running as a script")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## ‚úÖ Duck Typing

**Definition:**
A concept related to dynamic typing, where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck." In Python, you don't need to check an object's type to know if it has a certain method.

**Example:**

```python
class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack!")

class Person:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm quacking like a duck!")

def make_it_quack(duck):
    duck.quack()

make_it_quack(Duck())
make_it_quack(Person())
```
